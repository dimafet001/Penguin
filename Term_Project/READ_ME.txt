The self defined project I created was a 2d game involving the usage of many sprites. I also implemented and used the module pygame. Right away at the start of the program, I initialized game music to play throughout the game. The user also can start the game right away or go into the help screens where a story along with instructions will be displayed the user where he can then start the game. There is then a variety of difficulty options which will affect the game by setting the amount of "moves" you have. A move in this game is a click of the mouse button "called frost walk" where the user can create his own path. The user click and then an object appears at that location where the user can then interact with it. Place the objects wisely and there is only a limited amount depending on the difficulty level selected. The player moves by using the arrow keys and the space bar to jump. Interact with your frost walk ability which is key to beating the game. The user dies when falling off the 
map or colliding with an enemy where a sound effect will play also. The user respawns at the starting point of each level with one life lost. If the user loses all their lives, the game is over and the user can quit by hitting escape. If the user reaches the goal, then the level is finished. Multiple levels were created "10 to be exact" and the user can move to the next level by pushing "n" once reaching the goal. The object of the game is to complete all the levels without losing all their lives on one level. Lives are replenished after each level but clicks are not. Sound effects are also established throughout the game that play along with the gameplay music.
